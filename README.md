<!-- To the latter OGPC participants, please include this note. In order to host a website via github (fully free and has treated us very well) we must update this repository, overwriting the past years website. Please have two seperate repositorys for the sites, one for the actual website and TigardHighGDC.github.io stay up to date with the live code. Thank you -James Smith -->

# ðŸ’¾ Welcome to the System Reset Website! ðŸ’¾

This is the OGPC 2022 Website from ANSTAAFL represeting Tigard High SchoolðŸŸ©â¬›. The website was developed by [@gitJamoo](https://github.com/gitJamoo) and [@Sluggggg](https://github.com/Sluggggg). The website will not be supported unless the game gains attraction. 

The goal of this website was to provide information on the team and provide information on the game, System Reset, in a website.

The website was primarily written in HTML ![HTML](https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/martz90/hex/16/html-5-icon.png), CSS ![CSS](https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/martz90/hex/16/css-3-icon.png), and JavaScript ![JavaScript](https://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/alecive/flatwoken/16/Apps-File-Javascript-icon.png)

This was my [@gitJamoo](https://github.com/gitJamoo)'s first big project, and I am very happy with how it came out. Thank you! We hope you enjoy the website and our code.
